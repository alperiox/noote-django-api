# noote-django-api

![build](https://github.com/alperiox/noote-django-api/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Simple note taking application. It comes with facial recognition-based authentication methods.

TODOs:
- Need to build a REST API for the face recognition model, maybe use Jina as a neural search model. 
- The templates of the platform are done but haven't set up bootstrapcss support with django yet.
